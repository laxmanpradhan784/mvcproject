MVC Architecture Overview: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a widely adopted design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components, promoting organized code and enhancing maintainability. The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. For instance, consider a simple User model in PHP:

// models/User.php
class User {
    private $db;

    public function __construct($database) {
        $this->db = $database;
    }

    public function getUser($id) {
        // Retrieve user data from the database
        return $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [$id]);
    }
}

The Model handles data operations such as retrieval and validation, ensuring that the application’s state is accurately represented. The View is responsible for the user interface, displaying data and capturing user interactions. Here’s an example of a simple view in PHP:

// views/userProfile.php
<?php if ($user): ?>
    <h1><?php echo htmlspecialchars($user['name']); ?></h1>
    <p>Email: <?php echo htmlspecialchars($user['email']); ?></p>
<?php else: ?>
    <p>User not found.</p>
<?php endif; ?>

The View listens for changes in the Model and updates the UI accordingly, ensuring that users see the most current information. The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, processing user input and deciding which data to present. For example:

// controllers/UserController.php
class UserController {
    private $model;

    public function __construct($model) {
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function showProfile($id) {
        $user = $this->model->getUser($id);
        include 'views/userProfile.php'; // Load the view with user data
    }
}

In this example, the UserController retrieves user data through the Model and then loads the corresponding View to present that data to the user. This separation of concerns enhances modularity, allowing developers to work on individual components without affecting others. Furthermore, it facilitates testing, as each component can be tested independently. By adhering to the MVC architecture, applications become more scalable and easier to maintain, allowing for straightforward updates and feature additions over time.
